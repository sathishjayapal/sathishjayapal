# Hi, I'm Sathish 👋  
Cloud Architect | Technical Product Manager | Marathoner | Event‑Driven Systems & Kubernetes

I live at the intersection of Enterprise Cloud Architecture, Distributed Systems, and Endurance Sports.  
This space is where I experiment, learn in public, and share what works (and what really doesn’t).  
If you’re here for code, start with the Runs App and Infra/Terraform labs in the sections below.

## 🏗️ What I’m Building Now

- **Runs App (Personal Running Platform)**  
  A multi‑service running platform that ingests data from Garmin/Strava and gives deeper insights for marathon training.  
  Stack: **Java, Spring Boot, RabbitMQ/Kafka, Postgres, Docker, Kubernetes (WIP)**.  
  Focus areas: event‑driven ingestion, training‑cycle analytics, and opinionated APIs for runners and coaches.

- **Agentic AI Frameworks for Engineers**  
  Exploring AI agents to support engineers and platform teams:  
  - Auto‑triaging stale branches and PRs.  
  - Reconciling Terraform state with live Kubernetes/EKS/AKS resources.  
  - Drafting ADRs and changelogs from commit history.  
  Early experiments live in repos under `sathishjayapal` with “ai” or “agent” in the name.

- **EKS Resource Mapping & Infra Labs**  
  Working on taking an existing EKS cluster and reverse‑engineering it into maintainable Terraform modules.  
  This is part of a set of **infra labs** for engineers moving from “eksctl click‑next cluster” to “versioned, reviewed, Terraformed infra”.

## 📝 Architecture Deep Dives (Tek Blog)

I write longer, opinionated breakdowns of systems and patterns at **[sathishjayapal.me](https://sathishjayapal.me)**.

- **From eksctl to Terraform: Making Sense of EKS Resources**  
  How to reverse‑engineer an EKS cluster created with eksctl into clean Terraform modules you can actually maintain.  
  👉 Read: https://sathishjayapal.me/eksctl-to-terraform-eks-mapping/

- **Designing Scalable Queues for Real‑World Workloads** *(example title – replace with your real post)*  
  Patterns for moving from hobby queues to resilient RabbitMQ in production‑like setups: dead‑lettering, back‑pressure, and observability.  
  👉 Read: _link to post_

- **Running, Recovery, and Systems Thinking** *(if you have or plan a post tying running to architecture)*  
  Connecting long‑run training cycles, feedback loops, and how that maps to building reliable distributed systems.  
  👉 Read: _link to post_

I cross‑post selected articles to Medium with canonical links back to the blog so everything resolves to the source of truth.
