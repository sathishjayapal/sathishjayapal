# 🛠️ Sathish Jayapal – Laboratory of Systems & Resilience

**Cloud Architect | Event-Driven Systems Builder | Marathon Runner | Learning in Public**

I design distributed systems for cloud platforms and explore how **resilience principles** from endurance sports apply to building reliable software. This is my laboratory — where architecture thinking meets code, and theory meets the constraints of running real applications.

## 🎯 Where to Start

**If you're interested in:**

### 📐 **Event-Driven Systems & Distributed Transactions**
→ Start with **[EventsTracker](https://github.com/sathishjayapal/eventstracker)**  
A production-grade multi-service platform exploring RabbitMQ choreography, ShedLock coordination, and Kubernetes operations. Built to answer: *How do you handle distributed transactions and race conditions at scale?*

### 🏃 **Analytics for Distributed Systems (via Running Data)**
→ Start with **[Runs App](https://github.com/sathishjayapal/runs-ai-analyzer)** *(WIP)*  
Using semantic caching (PGVector + Claude) to analyze running data as a testbed for RAG patterns and real-time anomaly detection. Why? Because marathons taught me that **resilience is a system property**, not a component.

### 🏗️ **Infrastructure as Code & Kubernetes Ops**
→ Start with **[EKS Terraform Labs](https://github.com/sathishjayapal/eks-infra-labs)** *(WIP)*  
Reverse-engineering cloud-click clusters into versioned, reviewed, reproducible infrastructure. Learning to go from "eksctl create cluster" to "infrastructure as a git-reviewed system."

### 🤖 **Agentic AI for Engineering Workflows**
→ Explore **[AI Agent Experiments](https://github.com/sathishjayapal?q=ai-agent&type=source)**  
Auto-triaging stale branches, reconciling Terraform state with live resources, drafting ADRs from commit history. Early-stage exploration of how AI agents can reduce toil.

## 📚 Architecture Deep Dives (Read First, Then Code)

I write longer pieces at **[sathishjayapal.me](https://sathishjayapal.me)** (canonical source) and cross-post to [Medium @dotsky](https://dotsky.medium.com).

### Featured Posts (Start Here)

  Patterns for moving RabbitMQ from hobby projects to resilient production-like setups: dead-lettering, backpressure, observability. This thinking is baked into EventsTracker.

- **[Tackling Distributed Transactions in Microservices](https://dotsky.medium.com/tackling-distributed-transactions)** *(cross-posted)*  
  Using ShedLock for distributed task scheduling and avoiding race conditions in Kubernetes. Real constraints. Real solutions.

## 🏗️ What I'm Building Now

### EventsTracker — **MVP + Active**
A multi-service event ingestion platform built as a learning vehicle for Kubernetes, Spring Cloud, and distributed systems.
- **Why:** To understand how production systems handle distributed transactions, race conditions, and resilience at small scale before enterprise scale.
- **Tech:** Java 21 • Spring Boot 4.0 • RabbitMQ • PostgreSQL/Flyway • Kubernetes • Maven
- **Focus:** Event-driven choreography, ShedLock coordination, zero-trust microservice security.
- **Status:** Core event ingestion stable; Kubernetes deployment in progress.
- **Next:** Zero-downtime deployments, full observability (metrics/tracing).

### Runs App — **MVP + Active Learning**
A multi-service platform for ingesting and analyzing running data from Garmin/Strava.
- **Why:** Marathons taught me that resilience is a system property. I'm applying that insight to real-time athletic performance analytics.
- **Tech:** Java • Spring Boot • PGVector • PostgreSQL • Claude API • RabbitMQ/Kafka • Kubernetes (WIP)
- **Focus:** RAG-based semantic caching, real-time injury pattern detection, agentic AI coaching recommendations.
- **Status:** Garmin ingestion stable; semantic analysis in progress.
- **Next:** Kubernetes deployment, multi-region eventual consistency patterns.

### EKS Terraform Labs — **Learning Phase**
Reverse-engineering EKS clusters created with `eksctl` into clean, versioned Terraform modules.
- **Why:** Too many teams run "cloud click-next" deployments. This is how you move from ad-hoc to reviewable infrastructure.
- **Tech:** Terraform • AWS EKS • Kubernetes • Infrastructure as Code
- **Status:** Early exploration; learning the mapping from eksctl-generated resources to idiomatic Terraform.

### Agentic AI Experiments — **Early Stage**
Exploring AI agents to reduce engineering toil:
- Auto-triaging stale branches and PRs
- Reconciling Terraform state with live Kubernetes/EKS/AKS resources
- Drafting ADRs and changelogs from commit history

## 🏃‍♂️ Beyond Code

**Marathoner:** 9 marathon finishes. Every long run is a lesson in system design — feedback loops, resilience, constraint management, recovery.

**Thesis:** The principles that make distributed systems resilient (redundancy, graceful degradation, observability, feedback loops) are the same principles that make training cycles effective. I explore this at the intersection of both domains.

**Location:** Madison/Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. Always happy to discuss architecture over South Indian coffee.

## 🎓 What This Lab is About

This is **not a portfolio of finished products**. It's a **learning laboratory in public**:
- Real constraints (Kubernetes, distributed transactions, RAG patterns)
- Real decisions (documented in Architecture Decision Records)
- Real friction (MapStruct compilation, reconciling Terraform state)
- Real outcomes (blog posts, working applications, operational insights)

The goal is to **show how I think**, not just what I've built.

**Built with ☕ and 🏃. Always learning. Always building. Always honest.**
